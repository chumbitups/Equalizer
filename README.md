# Equalizer
Simple Equalizer with following features:  
• Spectrum Analyzer  
• Low Cut and High Cut settings (frequencies and slopes)  
• Peak settings (frequency, gain, quality)  

## Instructions
To launch Equalizer you have to do the following:

1. Download JUCE Framework: https://juce.com/get-juce/
2. To launch the project, you'll have to build in once via Projucer (code and IDE-generator from JUCE that allows you to launch the project in every OS and IDE)  
   Go to the JUCE folder -> extras -> Projucer -> Builds -> (name of your IDE) ->  
   For Windows and VS: open Projucer.sln    
   For Linux: open Makefile  
   For MacOS: open .xcodeproj file
3. In Projucer: you can either double-click on the .jucer file contained in the project folder (it is going to be added later) or click on Open Existing Project from the wizard. (You can also navigate to Open... from the Projucer's main menu.)
After that, you can launch the native IDE with your project directly from the Projucer. Use the button near the top:
